# DataBase-Project
 Complete data base created by me with web interface using Django

to run the server use the command: python manage.py runserver
PS: It needs to have the local database (I put the sql script for the database in the repository) and create a valid user with an username and password, and replace the user='your username' and password='your password' in the views.py (line 28) 

Some imports may be unused because I changed some things during the project, also it may not be the most efficient way to do things, but I learned everything by myself in a short period of time.

There are also some listings that may not make sense, they were requirements for the university project and I implemented them.
