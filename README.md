## A short look at the web interface

The web interface has been refactored to implement a new design that is more user-friendly and intuitive, as well as new features that improve the user experience like paginating the table results, sorting by clicking the column name and real-time search.

The landing page describes briefly the purpose of the app and shows the conceptual diagram for the database.

After clicking on a navbar button, the user is redirected to the specific table page where all CRUD operations can be performed as well as sorting and searching for specific records.

Each table page will look something like this:
